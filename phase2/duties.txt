Yupeng Huang: GUI design, tag history related method in Controller class.
I created every interface for this program using javaFX scene builder and i also wrote every controller for the front end interfaces.
For the controller I wrote, it has the function of connecting front end elements with back end elements,
and updating front end display to users if corresponding elements in back end is changed, the change is also being passed in from user input to my controller.
Changes will be updated in the backend by going through my controller.

Linhao Liu: Directory class, Connection structure of Controller and back-end,javadoc and partial modifiers. 
Phase2: UML diagram. Modify and add some Javadocs, directory can identify tags and add them to tag manager. Simplify several methods. Git ignore file.

Hengguang Zhou: SafeManager, ImageManager, Image, helped debugging in other classes. Writing unit test.
 For phase 2, I helped debugging other classes. Also, I introduced and discussed with my teammates about the idea of
 having a private image safe as a new feature to our program, and I took part in both back end class design and front end UI
 design.

Ping Ju Kan: Tag and TagManager class, add and remove tag method in Controller, and handle exceptions.help.txt. Modify bugs in logger.
 For phase 2, I implemented the image encrypting system that can allow the user to hide the images that they don't want to show others. Also connected
the backend of the encrypting system with the front end with Yupeng Huang. Also helped with testing out the program and debug the system. Also reduced
the cohesion among the TagManager and ImageManager together with Hengguang Zhou.

We all discussed and worked on each other's stuff to allow the main class work.
